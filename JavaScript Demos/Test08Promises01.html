    <h2>Promises Demo 01</h2>
	<h3>
	Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
	<br>A Promise has four states:
	<br>	fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
	<br>	rejected: Action related to the promise failed
	<br>	pending: Promise is still pending i.e not fulfilled or rejected yet
	<br>	settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected
	</h3>
	<h5>Check console log</h5>

    <script>
		var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { 
		  const x = 12; 
		  const y = 12
		  if(x === y) { 
			resolve(); 
		  } else { 
			reject(); 
		  } 
		}); 
		  
		promise. 
			then(function () { 
				console.log('Success, You are a GEEK'); 
			}). 
			catch(function () { 
				console.log('Some error has occured');
