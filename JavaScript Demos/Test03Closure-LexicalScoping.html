    <h2>Closures - Lexical Scoping Demo</h2>
	<h2>What is a Closure?</h2>
	<h3>A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
	<br>
	In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.</h3>

    <script>
        function init() {
		  var name = 'outer function'; // name is a local variable created by init
		  function displayName() { // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
			alert(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
		  }
		  displayName();
		}
		init();
    </script>
