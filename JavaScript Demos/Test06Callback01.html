    <h2>Callback Demo 01</h2>
	<h3>Callbacks are a great way to handle something after something else has been completed. By something, here we mean a function execution.
	<br>
	If we want to execute a function right after the return of some other function, then callbacks can be used.</h3>

    <script>
		// add() function is called with arguments a, b 
		// and callback, callback will be executed just  
		// after ending of add() function 
		function add(a, b , c){ 
			document.write(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a+b}.` +"<br>"); 
			c(); 
		} 

		// disp() function is called just 
		// after the ending of add() function  
		function disp(){ 
			document.write('This must be printed after addition'); 
		} 

		// Calling add() function 
		add(5,6,disp);
